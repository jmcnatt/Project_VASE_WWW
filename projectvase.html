						<h2>What is Project_VASE</h2>
						<p>As the world of computing continues to drive our productive lives, securing precious data
						is becoming more and more of an issue.  Every day, new software packages, updates, and patches
						are released to the public.  Are these pieces of software insecure?  Even the newest, most
						up-to-date packages from trusted vendors pose a future security risk.</p>
						<p>You may be asking yourself "How do we know what is secure and what isn't?"  It's the question
						we've asked ourselves.  Cyber criminals do not care about ethics and the law, and when they find
						an vulnerability and are able to acquire your data, they capitalize on it as much as possible.
						This is why we have created Project_VASE.  It is illegal to mimic the acts of criminals in the
						world wide web, or even in a private network.  Project_VASE is a completely separated environment from any
						other system, network, or internetwork.  Security threats can be tested and identified with no harm
						to others.  This useful information can be collected before the vulnerabilities become a weapon for a
						future cyber criminal. </p>
						
						<h2>How Project_VASE works</h2>
						<p>Project_VASE is built on VMware ESX, a powerful hypervisor by VMware, Inc.  Servers are linked
						together in a large cluster, sharing resources.  This cluster of computers can then virtualize many
						different Operating Systems in many different states.  Each Virtual Machine operates like a physical
						computer sitting on your desk, but without any of the hardware.  The cluster virtually provides the
						hardware with settings that can be modified.</p>
						<p>While many organizations use virtualized solutions in today's computing world, Project_VASE is
						unique.  Project_VASE uses VMware ESX for the purpose of virtualizing operating systems with different
						settings and in different groups, rather than virtualizing Operating Systems for the purpose of productivity
						or hosting services.  Vulnerabilities can be targeted with attacks by other Virtual Machines running in the
						environment without malicious traffic ever leaving the environment.</p>
